The Release Reports Task is a `Release Task Service <_release-task-service>`_ that collects summary statistics for a group of studies in the :ref:`Data Service` at the time a new release is started.
It exposes these stats through a basic REST API for consumers such as the :ref:`Release Coordinator` to consume and display.
