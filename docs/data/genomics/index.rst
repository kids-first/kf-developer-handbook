Genomic Data Lifecycle
======================

Genomics operations within Kids First serve two goals: To process and return quality, genomic data to X01 Project investigators as quickly as possible, and to process genomic data in a way that is as consintent and reproducable as possible.

The Kids First Program is an aggregate of many `X01 Projects <https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/X01Projects>`_ consisting of a diverse set of institutions, investigators, and research goals.
Investigators heading these projects are reliant on the Kids First Program to provide them with data so that they may continue their research objectives.
It is thus a major goal that Kids First be able to provide high-quality data in a timely manner to investigators so as not to impede their work.

Another primary objective of Kids First is to enable `data sharing <https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/FAQ#kf%20data%20sharing>`_ of pediatric genomics data.
Data sharing is enhanced through consitent and transparent processing which can provide more compatible and reproducible data.

Reciept
+++++++

The Kids First Genomic Data Lifecycle begins when the Data Resource Center recieves raw data from one of the partnered sequencing centers.
The format of this data is highly subject to conditions of the sequencing center that processed it and so must be revised through some rounds of cleaning and pre-processing.

Harmonization
+++++++++++++

To help meet the requirement of sharing consistent and compatible data, all genomics data accepted into Kids First must go through the harmonization preparation stage before being made available.
The result of this stage is genomic data that has been aligned on a common reference to ensure a compatible base for any further analysis.
